# GLPI Tools

This repository contains cross-platform tools to deploy and configure the GLPI Inventory Agent on Linux and Windows systems.

The project is organized using two separate branches:

- **Linux branch**: Contains the interactive Linux installer (`install-glpi-agent.sh`)
- **Windows branch**: Contains the Windows GUI installer (`Install-GlpiAgent-GUI.ps1`)

All components are interactive and require the user to supply their own GLPI inventory server URL and TAG at runtime. Nothing is hard-coded.
